# üè• Patient Management System

A microservices-based backend application built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, **Kafka**, and **AWS (simulated with LocalStack)**.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Microservices Architecture** ‚Äì Patient, Billing, Auth, Analytics, and API Gateway services.  
- **Service Communication** ‚Äì gRPC for direct communication and Apache Kafka for event-driven messaging.  
- **Security** ‚Äì JWT authentication for secure, authorized API access.  
- **Containerization** ‚Äì All services packaged as Docker containers.  
- **Cloud Simulation** ‚Äì AWS resources (ECS, RDS, MSK, etc.) deployed locally using AWS CDK with LocalStack.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
This project was built **for learning purposes** to understand how backend development works in a real-world setting:

- Designing and implementing microservices with Spring Boot.  
- Using gRPC and Kafka for scalable communication.  
- Deploying containerized services into a simulated AWS cloud with LocalStack.  
- Securing services with JWT.  

I followed tutorials and guidance from **Chris Blakely‚Äôs YouTube channel**, which inspired this project and helped me understand the fundamentals of backend microservice development.
